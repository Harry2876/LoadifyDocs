    ```

    Example for `settings.gradle`:

    ```groovy
    dependencyResolutionManagement {
        repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
        repositories {
            google()
            mavenCentral()
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }
    ```

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Add the Dependency">
    Add the following dependency to your app's `build.gradle` file inside the `dependencies` block:

    ```groovy
    implementation("com.github.Harry2876:Loadify:$version")
    ```

    Replace `$version` with the latest version of the library. You can find the latest version on the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/Harry2876/EzyLoaders/releases).
